My analysis is described in four Jupyter Notebook files, which are intended to be read in the following order:  
00 Executive Summary.ipynb  
01 Data Processing and EDA.ipynb  
02 Modeling - Vector Autoregression.ipynb  
03 Modeling - Random Forest.ipynb  

The following refers to the directory structure of the .zip folder:  
The data used consists of 4 small CSV files, which in total amount to less than 1 MB in size, so all data is included in the "Data" folder. 

All code is included in the Jupyter Notebook files with the exception of one Python script that imports and clean the data.   
This script is called "01 Import and Clean.py" and is located in the "Code" folder.   
The "01 Import and Clean.py" script is run by the "01 Data Processing and EDA.ipynb" saves out a file called "main.pkl".  
The "main.pkl" file is read in and used in each Jupyter Notebook file with the exception of "00 Executive Summary.ipynb", which contains no code.
